# Mastermind

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic game of Mastermind. A description of the game is provided below.

## The Game
At the start of the game, the computer generates a random code with a series of 4 colors chosen from a list of 6 colors. The player has ten tries to crack the code. Each turn, the player guesses a series of four colors, and then click a button to check the code. A black label appears for every guessed color that is correct and in the right position, and a white label appears for every guessed color that is correct and in the wrong position. This repeats itself up to ten times until the code is cracked or the game is lost.

**The full spec for this game is in the repo.**
